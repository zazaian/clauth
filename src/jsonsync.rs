//! Shared engine for clauth's "newest parseable copy wins" JSON reconcilers.
//!
//! Two Claude Code files need the same treatment: `.claude.json`
//! ([`crate::claude_json`]) and `settings.json` ([`crate::settings_sync`]). Both
//! exist as one logical document spread across the operator's own copy plus one
//! copy per profile runtime; both must converge on the fields that are user
//! preference while every copy keeps the fields that name its own account; and
//! both are rewritten in place by a Claude Code that can be caught mid-write.
//!
//! Only two things differ between them: the file name, and which keys are
//! per-profile. So the read/parse/skip, newest-wins, merge, member
//! enumeration, mtime-cache fast path, and atomic-write-only-on-change
//! machinery lives here once, and each caller supplies its base file plus one
//! [`KeyRule`] function.
