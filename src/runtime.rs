//! Per-session `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` trees used by `clauth start`.
//!
//! Every `clauth start <profile>` session gets its OWN runtime tree, keyed by a
//! session id (`<pid>-<seq>`):
//! `~/.clauth/profiles/<profile>/runtime-<sid>/`, or `runtime-isolated-<sid>/`
//! for an isolated run. The one exception is a SHARED session under
//! [`LinkMode::Fake`], which shares the bare-stem tree per profile (see the
//! keying rule below). Its `.credentials.json` still resolves to the profile's
//! canonical creds, so concurrent sessions of one profile observe a single
//! chain of refresh tokens. A watchdog thread in each parent process keeps the
//! runtime tree and canonical state in sync.
//!
//! The layout rests on ONE rule, which every enumeration below applies instead
//! of a hardcoded name list: a runtime dir named `runtime<rest>` pairs with the
//! sessions dir named `sessions<rest>`. It covers both flavors and also the
//! pre-per-session `runtime`/`sessions` pair an earlier release left on disk, so
//! liveness and GC reach a legacy tree with no migration step.
//!
//! Per-session keying follows the transport and the flavor. Under
//! [`LinkMode::Real`] every session gets its own `-<sid>` pair. Under
//! [`LinkMode::Fake`] an ISOLATED session gets one too, because its tree links
//! nothing from `~/.claude/`. A SHARED session under [`LinkMode::Fake`] still
//! falls back to the bare stem ([`paired_dir_names`]): its tree is a recursive
//! copy, so every session of that profile shares one tree. The accepted
//! consequence is that a fake-symlink host cannot give its SHARED sessions
//! independent credentials.
//!
//! Two transport modes, probed per profile at acquire time BEFORE the tree name
//! is chosen, since the mode decides that name:
//!
//! - **Real symlinks** (Unix, plus Windows with developer mode or admin):
//!   the runtime tree is a forest of symlinks into `~/.claude/`, and
//!   `.credentials.json` is a symlink into the profile's canonical creds.
//!   The watchdog only repairs the `.credentials.json` link when Claude
//!   Code's `unlink + write` re-login replaces it with a regular file.
//!
//! - **Fake symlinks** (symlink creation denied, or the filesystem does not
//!   support it, so `~/.clauth` on exFAT, FAT32 or SMB lands here on unix
//!   too): the runtime tree is built by recursive copy, and `.credentials.json`
//!   is a regular file. The watchdog walks both sides every tick and
//!   reconciles by "latest mtime wins" so a re-login on either side propagates
//!   to the other before another session can pick up a stale refresh token.
//!
//! Liveness lives in the paired sessions directory: the session creates the
//! marker `<sessions dir>/<sid>` and holds an exclusive `flock(2)` on it for
//! its lifetime, so any other process reads liveness without cooperation.
//! [`has_live_session`] unions every `sessions*` dir under the profile, so an
//! isolated session counts the same as a shared one; the destructive account
//! actions (delete, disable) gate on it everywhere. Token rotation gates on it
//! only on macOS ([`rotation_blocked_for`]): elsewhere the session reads the
//! very credential file a rotation writes and simply follows it, while on macOS
//! its Claude Code reads a Keychain item namespaced per `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` that
//! clauth cannot write. Teardown drops the marker and discards the tree. That
//! tree is the session's own except for a SHARED session under
//! [`LinkMode::Fake`], which is discarded only once the last session of the
//! profile has left; [`gc_stale_runtimes`] collects what a crashed session left
//! behind, of either flavor and in either layout.

/// The rows, and why each keeps or collects:

///   holds its marker, so its item stays: a live session's Claude Code reads
///   that item (CC resolves the Keychain before any file, namespaced per
///   `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`).
/// - a pair the sweep could not collect (a failed tombstone rename, an
///   unreadable tree) keeps its dir, and its item with it.
/// - a collected pair (the shared tree removed, the isolated tree renamed to
///   its rescue tombstone) has no dir and no live marker: its item is
///   orphaned — only that dir's hash resolved it — and is collected.
/// - a runtime dir that never existed (the orphaned-marker arm; a crash
///   between minting the marker dir and building the tree) derived no service,
///   and no tree ever hosted a session seed to write an item.
/// - a RE-MINTED pair — a concurrently starting session re-claimed the path
///   between the collection and the delete (#82) — holds its marker again, so
///   its item stays even before its dir is rebuilt: a live marker outranks
///   dir existence. An unreadable sessions dir (`None`) reads as live for the
///   same reason every destructive level here folds an unknown into sparing.
///
/// Both inputs are sampled in a fresh state-lock hold taken immediately
/// before the delete, never inside the collection's: the delete is a
/// subprocess and must never span the flock, so the lock is taken, the inputs
/// read, and dropped, and only then does the delete run — serialized against
/// an acquire's own lock section, which claims the marker and rebuilds the
/// tree as one step. What closes the tail that drop leaves — a queued acquire
/// completing its lock section and seeding the item between this re-check

///   `crate::lock::SUBPROCESS_BUDGET`, which the two coincide with today: that one
///   bounds a state-flock hold's shell-outs in aggregate and
///   `oauth::apply_rotated_tokens_locked` runs its mirror AFTER the closure ends,
///   where nothing clamps it. Kept in the sum on every host, for the reason stated
///   at the constant.
/// - [`SESSION_SEED_BUDGET`] — a macOS `clauth start` seeds the session's
///   per-config-dir Keychain item under this same lock (past the state flock,
///   before the guard drops), spending one shared budget across the carry and
///   the write. Same non-waste reasoning off macOS as the mirror term.
///
/// Everything else a healthy holder does is sub-millisecond disk work ON LINUX,
/// which is [`crate::lock::state_lock_timeout`]'s own qualification of the same
/// claim. A state-flock acquisition that reaches that deadline is the wedge THAT

/// something to budget for — but on macOS a peer can legitimately hold that flock

    /// the thing that keeps it off a session is the in-hold re-read below,
    /// serialized against that same flock. Neither seam can pose the narrower
    /// window on the other side of the flock acquisition — that one wants a
    /// thread holding the flock — so placement is pinned by `debug_assert!`s
    /// instead: `refuse_if_unconfigured`'s for the gate, the re-read's own
    /// for the field copy.

    /// `stamp_window_closing` and `hold_released` are the two halves of the
    /// shortened hold's pin, and they are separate because one question can only be
    /// asked from inside the hold and the other only from outside it.
    ///
    /// `stamp_window_closing` is the LAST statement of the flock closure, handed
    /// this session's own paths and id. It asks whether the two artifacts
    /// `rotation_blocked_for` reads — the marker's flock and the registry row — are
    /// on disk while the rotation lock is still held. Inside the closure is the

///   intentional; per-profile isolation would hide project history and

/// - **Per-profile:** `settings.json` (merged with profile overrides),
///   `.credentials.json` (the profile's own OAuth token chain), and
///   `.claude.json` (a copy seeded from `~/.claude.json`). Settings are

/// The table (from the codex plan):
/// - `auth.json` — under real symlinks, BOTH flavors link the profile's own
///   `profiles/<name>/auth.json`: one physical file is what makes concurrent
///   carriers safe (codex's own reload-and-skip handles codex-vs-codex, the
///   rotation guard handles clauth-vs-codex). Under [`LinkMode::Fake`] it is
///   a copy — the same consequences the claude fake-mode credential copy
///   already documents, sharpened by codex's single-use refresh chain: the
///   copy is a second carrier whose refreshes strand the store, and a
///   fake-mode host accepts that or does not run codex sessions.
/// - `config.toml` — a COPY of the operator's (codex writes it in place, so a
///   link would mutate the operator's own file). Absent operator config copies
///   nothing.
/// - the operator surfaces ([`CODEX_OPERATOR_ENTRIES`]) — shared flavor only,
///   links (fake: copies); isolated links nothing from the operator.
/// - the durable stores ([`CODEX_DURABLE_ENTRIES`]) — shared flavor under real
///   symlinks: links into the profile-global home, dangling until codex
///   creates through them, which is the point. Isolated: per-session. Fake:
///   the home IS the global store, nothing to link.
/// - the rollout roots ([`CODEX_ROLLOUT_ROOTS`]) — shared flavor under real
///   symlinks: links into the profile-global home, their targets created
///   first (codex creates `sessions/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/` through them, and a
///   `create_dir_all` cannot pass a dangling dir link). Isolated: a real
///   per-session `sessions/`, discarded by design. Fake: the home IS the
