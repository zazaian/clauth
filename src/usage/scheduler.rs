///   * LIVE window + a standing block → RE-TEST it, on the POLL cadence (ignoring
///     the deep `kick_due` backoff). Load-bearing: a live 5h window can be a
///     Claude-web open while Claude Code's `/v1/messages` stays 429'd for this
///     account, so window liveness does NOT clear the block — only a landed kick
///     does (`note_kick_outcome` `opened`). The lapsed-window backoff can ladder

///     in long after the account recovered, so a reopened window re-tests every
///     poll (~one refresh interval) until a kick lands or 429s afresh.
///
/// `queue_due` (the interleaved queue gate, `usage::auto_start_queue`) narrows the

/// probe on an already-open window whose verdict the fallback chain routes on
/// (`kick_block_switch_grade`), not a window open, so delaying it by up to
/// `5h / N` would leave the chain refusing to switch back to an account that
/// had already recovered.
///
